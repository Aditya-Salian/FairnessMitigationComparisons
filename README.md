Images directory contains the image of the rubrics we intend to address in this project.

Adult-Income-EDA+Fairness.ipynb contains our EDA on Fairness in the Adult Dataset.

COMPAS-EDA+Fairness.ipynb contains our EDA on Fairness in the COMPAS Dataset.

Loan-Approval-EDA+Fairness.ipynb contains our EDA on Fairness in the Loan Prediction Dataset Dataset.

Logistic_Regression_COMPAS.ipynb is our notebook on COMPAS which contains the results of Logistic Regression model before and after fairness is achieved.
